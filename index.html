            <h2>I Use Arch Linux BTW</h2>
            <p>Arch Linux is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that follows a rolling release model,
                meaning it continuously updates rather than requiring major version upgrades.
                It is designed for advanced users who prefer to customize their operating system from the ground up,
                allowing them to install only the software they need. Arch uses the Pacman package manager for easy software installation and management. 
                Its philosophy emphasizes simplicity, transparency, and user centrality, 
                encouraging users to understand the system they are using. 
                The Arch Wiki is a comprehensive resource that provides extensive documentation and support for users.  </p>
